# MenuSystemWithZenject

This project is a Unity Menu Framework inspired by 
MenuSystem

and Zenject

#
I started this project because my project is written with Zenject and I want the MenuSystem to work with Zenject as well.
So inspired by the idea of MenuSystem, I did some modification to it and I think the result is quite pleasing.
